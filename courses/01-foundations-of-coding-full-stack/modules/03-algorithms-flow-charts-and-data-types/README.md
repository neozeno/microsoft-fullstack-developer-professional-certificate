# Algorithms, Flow Charts, and Data Types

In this module, we explore the structure of algorithms, including if/then
statements, categorical logic, and binary operations. I learned how to use
flowcharts to visualize logical steps and identify different data types like
integers, floats, and booleans. Having finished this module, now I'm capable of
declaring variables and implementing a simple algorithm in C# to solve
basic problems.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the structure of algorithms (if/then, categorical statements, binary)
- Use flowcharts to visualize logical steps
- Identify different data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans, etc.)
- Declare variables in C#
- Implement a simple algorithm in C#
