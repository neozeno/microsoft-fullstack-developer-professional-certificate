# Foundations of Coding Full-Stack

These are my notes on the [Foundations of Coding Full-Stack](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-coding-full-stack/home/info) course,
which is the course 1 of 12 in the [Microsoft Full-Stack Developer Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/microsoft-full-stack-developer).

## About this Course

This course covers the foundational concepts of full-stack development.
I learned the basics of coding, problem-solving, and writing efficient,
modular code, while gaining hands-on experience
with both front-end and back-end technologies.

Upon taking this course, I was able to:

- Summarize the foundational principles and practices of full-stack development.
- Plan full-stack projects using industry-standard tools and methodologies.
- Apply logical thinking and problem-solving techniques in programming.
- Design algorithms and flowcharts to represent logical steps in programming.
- Implement control structures and loops for repetitive tasks.
- Develop modular code using functions and methods.

## Course Syllabus

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to full-stack development,
starting with foundational principles and progressing
through logical problem-solving, algorithm design, and project planning.
I gained hands-on experience applying control structures, loops,
and modular coding techniques using functions and methods.
With a focus on front-end and back-end integration.
The course also covered using industry-standard tools
such as GitHub for version control and Microsoft Copilot for debugging.
The course culminated in a project where I developed a complete code project,
reinforcing the skills necessary for full-stack development.
